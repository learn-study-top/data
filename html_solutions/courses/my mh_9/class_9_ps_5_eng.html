    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>India, being one of the most significant countries in the world, frequently engages in diplomatic and international relations through visits made by its leaders, particularly the President and the Prime Minister. These foreign tours are a crucial part of India's foreign policy and play an essential role in strengthening diplomatic ties, fostering economic growth, and enhancing global cooperation. This project aims to gather information about the foreign tours of the President and the Prime Minister of India, focusing on their objectives, destinations, and outcomes.</p>

    <h2>1. Foreign Tours of the President of India</h2>
    <p>The President of India is the ceremonial head of state, and while they may not be as directly involved in day-to-day government decisions, foreign tours by the President are important for strengthening India’s diplomatic relations with other countries. The President’s visits often include meetings with heads of state, addressing international forums, and participating in various diplomatic, cultural, and economic discussions.</p>

    <h3>Objectives of Presidential Foreign Tours:</h3>

        <li><strong>Strengthening bilateral relations:</strong> Building stronger political, economic, and cultural ties with other countries.</li>
